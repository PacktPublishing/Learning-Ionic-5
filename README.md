# Learning Ionic 5
Learning Ionic 5, published by [Packt]

## About The Course

Ionic is a leading open-source framework for building hybrid mobile applications. You kick off the course with an introduction to the Ionic ecosystem, which will guide you through all the frameworks and tools that comprise the Ionic ecosystem, unboxing a preview of what is new about the framework. 

Next you dive into developing with the framework, beginning the development of an app from the Ionic CLI, editor, and web browser. In this course, you will build a Home Emergency Inventory App, which lets you input an item's details, such as a receipt copy, a picture, a description, how much it's worth, how much you paid and where you bought it. This is going to be very important especially if a disaster occurs and all your stuff is destroyed. 
You will wrap up testing and deploying the app and at the end of the course, you will be up and running with Ionic 5 for building hybrid web applications.
